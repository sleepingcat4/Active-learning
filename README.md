# Active Learning

## Introduction
Active Learning is discipline in Artificial intelligence which deals with one of the fundamental questions “Data and annotations for the data”, 

I stumbled on the concept while working to improve model quality for a startup. And it got me hooked. There are two types of Active Learning:

1. Classical Active learning 
2. Deep Active Learning (Batch Method)

In Classical Active Learning, we prioritise a single page at a given time. Methods used are statistical ranking systems. Whereas in Deep Active Learning, a field where we perform sophisticated and probabilistic ranking on a batch of images/data per iteration. 

### Why’s this repository?
Learning materials are available for Active Learning, but these are scarce in terms of either being fully literature/mathematical. Which I assume, an obstacle for many. Programming something hand-on gives you better insight as it’s a concept which is used in your models. 

I have compiled my sources where I learnt active learning from and as well as, my own written Algorithms on the most common active learning ranking system aka **Acquisition functions based on the explanation of Jacob Gildenblat.** 

Later on I will be adding my fav active learning field research papers, which is the foundational block of Modern Active Learning research.
